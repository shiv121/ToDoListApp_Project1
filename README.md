Most of the things are straightforward.
I can add a task(title, description and date) by using "Add Task" button. 
The tasks can be put in priority queues of "Pending", "In-Progress" and "Completed"(these are just hypothetical priorities).
Local storage is enabled to store the data so that when the browser is closed and reopened later - the data sticks.
The tasks can be moved from one queue to another by drag-and-drop. 
The task can be deleted by drag-and-drop to the "delete zone" on the "Add task" panel.
The task description box is limited to 140 characters. The characters left to enter are shown below the box and goes red when it is less than 0. Also the "Add Task" button gets disabled at this instance.
The local storage can be reset by "Clear All Data" button.
The application works with keyboard and mouse inputs and is fast to load and use.
